# Advent of Code Solutions

I've been doing AoC to try and brush up on langauges I havn't used in a long time or to learn languages I don't know, so expect these to be a bit rough:

  - **2021**: re-learning javascript after may years, so learning all the new features since ES5 or so, really.
  - **2022**: learning rust while reading [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html) and getting help from friends.
