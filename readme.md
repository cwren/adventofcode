# Advent of Code Solutions

I've been doing [AoC](https://adventofcode.com/) to try and brush up on langauges I haven't used in a long time or to learn languages I don't know, so expect these to be a bit rough:

  - **[2021](2021/)**: re-learning javascript after may years, so learning all the new features since ES5 or so, really.
  - **[2022](2022/)**: learning rust while reading [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html) and getting help from friends.
